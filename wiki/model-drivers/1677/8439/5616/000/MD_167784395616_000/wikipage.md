The Tunable Intrinsic Ductility Potential (TIDP) of Rajan, Warner and Curtin is based on standard Morse potential. The ductility is tuned by altering the tail of $$\varphi(r)$$ while leaving the energy well unchanged. The functional form is

$$
\varphi(r)=
\begin{cases}
(1-\exp[-\alpha(r-1)])^2-1 & r \le r_1 \\
\end{cases}
$$
