## Description
This **Model Driver** implements the Stillinger-Weber three-body potential for Si
## Parameters
Symbols:

$$ a, A, B, p, q, \sigma, \lambda, \gamma$$

Corresponding variables in code:
a, A, B,p,q, sigma,lamda,gamma

## Details

The total potential energy function $$ \phi $$ for Si crystal is approximated by a combination of a pair and three-body potential v_2 and v_3 respectively. It takes the following form:
