WARNING: This version of this driver has known bugs when dealing with multiple species.  Specifically, the density values evaluated are swapped between the species of the target atom and the current neighbor atom.  For example, suppose a dimer is considered with atom 1 of species A and atom 2 of species B separated by a distance $r^\ast$.  Because of this bug, the EAM density ascribed to atom 1 will be $\rho_A(r^\ast)$ despite the fact that atom 2 is of species B.  Similarly, the EAM density ascribed to atom 2 will be $\rho_B(r^\ast)$ despite the fact that atom 1 is of species A.  Version 002 of the driver has corrected for this bug.
