In 1984, G.C. Abell noted that the bond energies of a particular structure can be expressed using pairwise interactions which are modified to suitably incorporate the effect of the local environment. Tersoff introduced a Morse-like potential which utilized this concept. This potential was known to be quite successful in reproducing surface reconstruction energies but was inaccurate in some cases such as the Pandey defect reconstruction, i.e. cases wherein $$\pi$$ bonding was important. Furthermore it wrongly predicted the bcc phase to be more stable than the diamond structure and was inapplicable to the graphitic structure of silicon. Dodsen, in 1987, tried to improve this potential by adding another parameter, but the results were insufficient. Also, the equilibrium atomic distance found from Dodsen's potential function was within 5
