**Data used in fitting:**

This potential's parameters were fitted using the equilibrium, zero-temperature lattice constants of bcc and fcc iron ($$\alpha$$-Fe and $$\gamma$$-Fe, resp.), the cohesive energy of bcc iron, the unrelaxed monovacancy formation energy in bcc iron, the potential energy difference that exists between the equilibrium bcc and fcc Fe lattices, and the cubic elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, C$$_{44}$$) of bcc Fe.  First-principles relaxed formation energies of <100>, <110>, and <111> dumbbell interstitials was also present in the training set, as well as an experimental value for the average density of liquid iron.  Finally, the radial distribution function (referred to as the pair correlation function (PCF) in the article cited below) determined from liquid Fe configurations which were generated using a simple pair potential (see text for more details) was used to determine its parameters.
