**Data used in fitting:**

* V-V
    * Lattice constant and elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, and C$$_{44}$$) of bcc V
    * Relaxed monovacancy formation energy in bcc V
    * <100>, <110>, and <111>, crowdion, and octahedral self-interstitials in bcc V
    * Lattice constant of fcc V
    * Difference in cohesive energy between bcc and fcc V

* Fe-Fe

* Al-Fe
    * Lattice constant of bcc V
    * Lattice constant of bcc Fe
    * Relaxed formation energy and lattice constant resulting from a single Fe substitutional impurity in a 16-atom supercell of bcc V
    * Interaction energy of a monovacancy in bcc V with a single Fe substitutional impurity.  A 128-atom bcc V supercell was initially formed (4 x 4 x 4 conventional unit cells at the equilibrium lattice constant for bcc V) and a vacancy was introduced.  The Fe substitutional impurity was placed at a nearest-neighbor site relative to the monovacancy.  Overall, the supercell thus contained 126 V atoms and 1 Fe atom.
    * Mixed [001], [011], and [111] dumbbell interstitials in a 128-atom (4 x 4 x 4) bcc V supercell.  This means that 128 V atoms and 1 Fe atom was present in each case.
