### Pair term:
A plot of the pair potential as a function of the scalar distance is shown in Figure 1.

### Three-body term:
A plot showing the angular component of the three-body term is shown in Figure 2, and a contour plot of the distance-dependent component of the three-body term is shown in Figure 3.

### Material parameters
$$
A=7.049556277\\
B=0.6022245584\\
p=4\\
q=0\\
a=1.80\\
\gamma=1.20\\
\lambda_1=25\\
c_0=-0.5\\
c_1=0.15\\
\sigma=2.0951\ \unicode{xC5} \\
\epsilon=2.32\ eV\\
$$
Many of the material parameters are taken to be the same as in the SW potential: *A, B, p, q, a* and $$\gamma$$ are the same as in the SW potential. The new parameters, $$\lambda_1$$, $$c_0$$ and $$c_1$$ are fit to data from bulk silicon and silicon clusters and are given in Reference 4. In order to make Figure 2, which matches Figure 1 in Gong 1993, it was realized that $$c_1$$ was **0.15**, not 0.45 as given in the article. The values of all parameters are shown above. In order to be consistent with the experimental cohesive energy of -4.63 eV/atom, the energy unit of the SW potential was scaled from 2.17 to 2.32 eV.
