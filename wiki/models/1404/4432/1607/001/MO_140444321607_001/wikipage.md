**Data used in fitting:**

This potential, denoted "CS3-33" in the article cited below, was fitted to experimental values of the BCC ($$\alpha$$-iron) equilibrium lattice constant and second-order elastic constants, but *not* its cohesive energy.  Experimental values for the third-order elastic constants of ferromagnetic BCC $$\alpha$$-iron were also used in fitting, as well as as ab-initio data for the relaxed formation energies of vacancy and single self-interstitials: <100>, <111>, and <110> dumbbell interstitials, octahedral and tetrahedral site interstitials, and the <111> crowdion interstitial.  Finally, a DFT-derived nearest-neighbor string potential curve (obtained by "...continually displacing a [111] string of atoms in the [111] direction without relaxing the surrounding lattice...") is used for fitting.

In addition to the above properties of ferromagnetic $$\alpha$$-iron, DFT values of the bulk equilibrium properties of non-magnetic $$\alpha$$-iron are included in the fitting database.  Finally, the average cohesive energy per atom in the ferromagnetic FCC ($$\gamma$$-iron) phase was required to be greater than that of the BCC phase during fitting.

**Cutoffs:**
Both the pair potential and the density function of this Finnis-Sinclair-type Model have a cutoff of 4.0 Angstroms. This means that the effective range for *atomic forces* is 8.0 Angstroms.  In practical terms, the pair potential decays to an absolute value of less than 0.01 eV at 3.48 Angstroms and the density decays to an absolute value of 0.01 at 3.403 Angstroms, yielding an effective force cutoff of 6.883 Angstroms.
