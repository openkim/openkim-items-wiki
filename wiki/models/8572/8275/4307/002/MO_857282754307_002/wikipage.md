**Notes:**

Despite the focus of the article cited below being placed on many-body (EAM) extensions of pair potentials which retain their predictions for the cohesive energy and lattice constant, while only minimally affecting the bulk modulus they predict, this Model only corresponds to the Modified Johnson pair potential itself.  It does *not* contain any code which implements many-body contributions.
