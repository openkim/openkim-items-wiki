The graph below is plotted assuming a tetrahedral geometry and that the atom under consideration is equidistant from its neighboring 4 atoms at all times:

The following graph is plotted as $$b_{ij}$$(KDS) vs $$\theta_{jik}$$ for a system of 3 atoms located at the corners of a triangle. The selected atom remains at an equilibrium distance of 2.3 $$A^{\circ}$$ from the other atoms, and the bond angle at the selected atom is varied.

The graph below is plotted considering a system of 4 atoms located at the corners of the rhombus. One atom is selected and is moved about the direction of the diagonal passing through it, hence varying the bond angle it forms with its neighboring atoms and as well as varying the distance it is located from its neighboring atoms. In this configuration, the selected atom always stays at an equal distance from its neighboring atoms, as it is moved along the diagonal passing through it. The rest of the 3 atoms are assumed to be fixed in the system with an equilibrium angle and at equilibrium distance from each other. It is assumed that the equilibrium angle is $$109.47^\circ$$ and the equilibrium distance between the atoms is 2.3 $$A^{\circ}$$.
