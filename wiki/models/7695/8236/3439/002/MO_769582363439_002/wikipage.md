**Data used in fitting:**

This potential's parameters were fitted using the equilibrium, zero-temperature lattice constants of bcc and fcc iron ($$\alpha$$-Fe and $$\gamma$$-Fe, resp.), the unrelaxed monovacancy formation energy in bcc iron, the potential energy difference that exists between the equilibrium bcc and fcc Fe lattices, and the cubic elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, C$$_{44}$$) of bcc Fe.  In addition, first-principles (GGA DFT) atomic forces found in liquid Fe configurations, generated using a simple pair potential, were used to determine its parameters (see text for more details).
