**Notes:**

This potential is identical to [model_Fe_PF_mendelev__MO_856295952425_001](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_856295952425_001).  They differ only in terms of their specific implementation.

**Data used in fitting:**

This potential's parameters were fitted using the equilibrium, zero-temperature lattice constants of bcc and fcc iron ($$\alpha$$-Fe and $$\gamma$$-Fe, resp.), the unrelaxed monovacancy formation energy in bcc iron, the potential energy difference that exists between the equilibrium bcc and fcc Fe lattices, and the cubic elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, C$$_{44}$$) of bcc Fe.  First-principles relaxed formation energies of <100>, <110> and <111> dumbbell interstitials was also present in the training set, as well as an experimental value for the average density of liquid iron.  In addition, first-principles (GGA DFT) atomic forces found in liquid Fe configurations which were generated using a simple pair potential (see text for more details) were used to determine its parameters.
