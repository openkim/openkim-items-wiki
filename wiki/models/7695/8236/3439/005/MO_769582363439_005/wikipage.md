**Notes:**

This potential is identical to [EAM_MagneticCubic_MendelevHanSrolovitz_2003_Fe__MO_856295952425_002](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_856295952425_002).  They differ only in terms of their specific implementation.  The Fe-Fe interactions of [EAM_Dynamo_BonnyPasianotMalerba_2009_FeNi__MO_267721408934_005](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_267721408934_005) and [EAM_Dynamo_BonnyPasianotCastin_2009_FeCuNi__MO_469343973171_005](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_469343973171_005) are similar to those of this potential but were altered to account for certain invariances of the energy inherent to the EAM formalism.

**Data used in fitting:**

This potential's parameters were fitted using the equilibrium, zero-temperature lattice constants of bcc and fcc iron ($$\alpha$$-Fe and $$\gamma$$-Fe, resp.), the unrelaxed monovacancy formation energy in bcc iron, the potential energy difference that exists between the equilibrium bcc and fcc Fe lattices, and the cubic elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, C$$_{44}$$) of bcc Fe.  First-principles relaxed formation energies of <100>, <110> and <111> dumbbell interstitials were also present in the training set, as well as an experimental value for the average density of liquid iron.  In addition, first-principles (GGA DFT) atomic forces found in liquid Fe configurations which were generated using a simple pair potential (see text for more details) were used to determine its parameters.

For those interested in this potential, the source article listed at the top of this page (Mendelev. Phil. Mag. 83, 2003) also includes a comparison with [EAM_Dynamo_AcklandBaconCalder_1997_Fe__MO_142799717516_005](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_142799717516_005).
