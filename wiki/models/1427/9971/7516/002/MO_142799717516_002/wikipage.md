Data used in fitting:

The parameters of this potential correspond to those given in Tables 2 and 3 of the first citation listed below (Ackland, Bacon, Calder, and Harry).  The data used to fit these parameters consists of the lattice parameter, cohesive energy, and elastic constants (C$$_{11}$$, C$$_{12}$$, and C$$_{44}$$) of $$\alpha$$-iron, which possess a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice geometry.  An estimate of the unrelaxed vacancy formation energy in $$\alpha$$-iron (1.89 eV) was also used in fitting.  No data for face-centered cubic (FCC) iron was used in the parameter fitting process.
