Title: Simple analytical embedded-atom-potential model including a long-range force for fcc metal and their alloys.
Link: http://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.54.8398

The model is applied to seven fcc metal (Al, Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd, and Pt) and their binary alloys. All the considered properties, whether for pure metal systems or for alloy systems, are predicted to be satisfactory at least qualitatively.

Pure metal: lattice constants, elastic constant (c11, c12, c44), potential parameters for this model are provided.
Alloy: lattice constants (both from this potential and from first principal calculation), ground energy are provided.
A3B-type alloy with L12 structure.
B3A-type alloy with L12 structure.
AB-type alloy with L10 structure.
