This model contains the parameters for Si–C interaction from [Tersoff's multicomponent potential](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.39.5566). Please note that the original paper contains two typos for the C–C interaction, which is given correctly in the [earlier description of the carbon parameters](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.2879) and in the [erratum](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.41.3248.2). The present model uses the correct parameters, although Tersoff notes in the erratum that the errors seem to be too small to be of much consequence.
