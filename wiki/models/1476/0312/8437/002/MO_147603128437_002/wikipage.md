**Data used in fitting:**

This potential is a shifted version of the Morse potential described in the citation listed below.  The *original* parameters in Girifalco & Weizer (Phys. Rev., 114(3), 1959) were fitted based on experimental values of the cohesive energy, equilibrium lattice constant, and compressibility of $$\alpha$$-iron, which has a body-centered cubic crystal structure.
