The Fe-Fe interactions in this potential are identical to those of [EAM_Dynamo_Ackland_Mendelev_FeP__MO_884343146310_002](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_884343146310_002).  The Fe-C and C-C interactions were fitted to ab initio data [1] for "...energetics and local geometries of carbon in pure $$\alpha$$-Fe (which has a body-centered cubic crystal structure), and the binding of carbon to vacancy and <110> self-interstitial type crystal defects."  Additionally used in the fitting process was a value of 6.27 eV for the solvation energy of atomic carbon in $$\alpha$$-Fe, which was inferred from experiment (see the cited source and associated reference made within for more details).
