**Data used in fitting:**

The Fe-C and C-C interactions were fitted to ab initio data [1] for "...energetics and local geometries of carbon in pure $$\alpha$$-Fe (which has a body-centered cubic crystal structure), and the binding of carbon to vacancy and <110> self-interstitial type crystal defects."  Additionally used in the fitting process was a value of 6.27 eV for the solvation energy of atomic carbon in $$\alpha$$-Fe, which was inferred from experiment.  Please refer to  [EAM_Dynamo_Ackland_Mendelev_FeP__MO_884343146310_002](https://openkim.org/cite/MO_884343146310_002) for properties used to fit Fe-Fe interactions.
